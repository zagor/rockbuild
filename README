Rockbuild is a system for running a heterogeneous distributed build farm over
the internet (long latency and low bandwidth).

It was developed for the Rockbox project and is used there for building 178
targets after every commit. Thanks to a build farm of 50+ clients, this
usually takes less than two minutes.

It has since been generalized to be applicable on any project in need of
fast compile feedback.
